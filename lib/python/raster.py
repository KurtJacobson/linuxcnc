        The programmer component is used to program the realtime raster component

        The raster component operates on line at a time.

        Example:
            Assuming rastering is done accross the X axis.
            A simple raster program would be from X=0.0 Power=0.0 to X=1.0 Power=100.0
            As the x axis passes from x0.0 to x1.0 the power will rise from 0 to 100 linearly.

            Because positional data at the hal level is joint position the program must be relative
            to the current position that the machine is at when programming the line.

            Because a port can become full each command waits until the port is available for writing. The commands will
            raise a ProgrammerException if too much time passes before the write completes. This is usually an indication
            that your PORT buffer isn't large enough
